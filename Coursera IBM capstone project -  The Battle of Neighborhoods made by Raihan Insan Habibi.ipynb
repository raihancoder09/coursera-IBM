By the beginning of 2020, approximately 20% of adulteries of the whole population (estimated around 34 million people) has Type 1 Diabetes. and almost 70% of the people are overweight, and 30% are obese, these factors of bad habit can lead to Type 2 diabetes. While many scientists are still finding new ways to prevent this, other experts like Data scientists need access to data and information for current situations in the city, such as the availability and the geographic distribution. Where is the most populated place that has diabetes? What is the cause of it? Is the city more dense with restaurants than other places like museums, parks, gyms, etc? In this report, I will talk about how these questions can lead to better results by describing simple analysis by using data science and visual tool kits."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.11","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
